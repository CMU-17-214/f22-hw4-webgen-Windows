                        <h2>FluggleBurgh 2017</h2><h3>juggling * acro * flow arts * aerial</h3><h3>Nov 10-12, Pittsburgh, PA</h3><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/106536766765807">Facebook Event</a></p><h4>About</h4><p><strong>FluggleBurgh</strong> is a 3-day festival for all circus and skill arts hosted by Pittsburghs juggling, acro, and flow arts community (fluggle = flow + juggle). It will be held at the <a href="http://www.forge.community/">Community Forge Space</a>, a former school, in Wilkinsburg PA, just outside of Pittsburgh. FluggleBurgh will provides a communal practice space with tall ceilings, numerous classrooms with scheduled workshops all weekend, outdoor practice and fire space (weather permitting), object manipulation games/competition, and two shows. All walks of object manipulation and movement arts are welcome.</p><p>In spirit, it is a successor of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_janE-erfKc">Not Quite Pittsburgh Juggling Festival</a> (2008-2015).</p><p>Our big goal of this festival is to bring the various communities around circus arts and other skills from Pittsburgh and beyond together, share workshops, and showcase the various skills in a show. We expect plenty of juggling, acrobatics, aerial, and flow workshops, as well as some clowning, balloons, and maybe even magic and pogo.</p><h4>Program (subject to change)</h4><p><strong>Gym times (open practice, workshops)</strong>Friday Nov 10, 5pm-1amSaturday Nov 11, 9am-6pm and 9:30pm-1amSunday Nov 12, 10am-3pm</p><p><strong>Shows</strong>Friday Nov 10, 8pm: Free Fire Show, outside (free)Saturday Nov 11, 7pm-9pm: Public Show at the Winchester Thurston School (10$)<em>The fire show will be outside on the grounds of the Community Forge space; it will be canceled or moved in case of heavy rain. The Saturday show will feature juggling, flow, acro, aerial, and clowning acts, many of them local to the Pittsburgh area. The exact lineup will be a surprise, but it will be moderated by our own <a href="http://www.oryanarrowroot.com/about">Oâ€™Ryan McGowan-Arrowroot</a> and will include acts from <a href="https://www.christiankloc.com/">Christian Kloc</a>, <a href="http://trevorjuggling.com/index.htm">Trevor Pearson</a>, Taylor Haverty, Garrett Borawski, and the <a href="http://www.steelcityclownbrigade.org/">Steel City Clown Brigade</a>.
