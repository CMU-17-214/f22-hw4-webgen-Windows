                        <h2>FluggleBurgh 2019</h2><h3>juggling * acro * flow arts * circus</h3><h3>Nov 1-3, Pittsburgh, PA</h3><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1437911102999501/">Facebook Event</a></p><h4>About</h4><p><strong>FluggleBurgh</strong> is a 3-day festival for all circus and skill arts hosted by Pittsburghs juggling, acro, and flow arts community (fluggle = flow + juggle). It will be held at the Winchester Thurston School in the heart of Pittsbugh. FluggleBurgh will provide a communal practice space with tall ceilings, classrooms with scheduled workshops all weekend, outdoor practice and fire space (weather permitting), object manipulation games/competition, and shows. All activities will be in the same space. All walks of object manipulation, circus arts, and movement arts are welcome.</p><p>In spirit, it is a successor of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_janE-erfKc">Not Quite Pittsburgh Juggling Festival</a> (2008-2015). Now, the festival is actually within the Pittsburgh city limits.</p><p>Our big goal of this festival is to bring the various communities around circus arts and other skills from Pittsburgh and beyond together, share workshops, and showcase the various skills in a show. We expect plenty of juggling, acrobatics, and flow workshops, as well as some clowning, balloons, and maybe even magic and unicycling.</p><h4>Program (subject to change)</h4><p><strong>Gym times (open practice, workshops)</strong>Friday Nov 1, 2019, 5pm-11pmSaturday Nov 2, 2019, 10am-11pm (gym closes during show)Sunday Nov 3, 2019, 10am-3pm</p><p>We ask for $5 per day for all activities in the gym to help offset the cost of the festival (rent, insurance, ...). Winchester Thurston students and their families can join for free, so do CMU students. We offer a discounted $20 weekend package that includes all three days in the gym and a ticket for the main show.</p><p><strong>Fire Jam (Friday Nov 1, 8pm, free)</strong>The fire jam is informal and will be outside on the school&#39;s grounds, weather permitting. It will be canceled or moved in case of heavy rain.</p><p><strong>FluggleBurgh Gala Show (Saturday Nov 2, 7pm-9pm, Winchester Thurston -- Auditorium)</strong>FluggleBurgh Gala Show (10$, cash only or buy <a href="https://carnegiemellontickets.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=1948&p=1">online</a> in advance, free for CMU students): The Gala show on Saturday will be at Winchester Thurston as well.

As usual <a href="http://www.oryanarrowroot.com/about">O’Ryan McGowan-Arrowroot</a> will guide through the show.Show tickets can be bought in the gym during the festival, or at the door for $10 (cash only).

The festival is in the school&#39;s gym and can be accessed from the parking lot (next to the soccer field). The school is in the heart of Pittsburgh&#39;s Shadyside neighborhood and close to numerous bus stops (including 28X, P1, 71A-D, 75). There are many restaurants nearby, many of them in nearby Walnut Street. There are numerous hotels nearby; for more budget-friendly places to stay look at AirBnB or look for hotels in the outskirts of town toward Monroeville or toward the airport. The site is only a short walk from CMU, Pitt and Chatham University.</p><h4>T-Shirts</h4><p>We have new t-shirts this year. If you missed getting a t-shirt last year, we still have several left.
